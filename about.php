	<p>I am a Web Developer based in Austin, Texas that specializes in building web solutions for non-profits to enable them to raise money and further their causes. While a lot of my work tends to be for non-profits, I am eager to take on projects from other sectors. I take pride in delivering quality websites that are easily managed and updated with little or no technical knowledge.</p>
	<p>I utilizes the latest web development technologies including JavaScript (React, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, ES6), HTML5, Sass, Bootstrap, AJAX and consuming REST APIs, Build Tools (Grunt and Webpack), Version Control (Git and SVN), and Continuous Integration (Deploybot, Buildkite, and Travis) .</p>
	<p>I graduated from Indiana University with a Bachelor of Arts in History and went on to earn my Masters in Asian Studies at the University of Texas. During this time I was fascinated with Chinese culture, and used my time in school to study Chinese history and language.</p>
	<p>After recieving my masters, I became interested in the non-profit sector and went to work at United Way of Greater Austin. It was here that I became invloved with web development as I managed their website. Currently I work at <a href="http://www.charitydynamics.com">Charity Dynamics</a> with with a great group of passionate developers, designers, consultants and project managers. </p>
	<p>In my free time I enjoy playing dominoes (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvgE30OYAf-qdGIzQmNEU3pIem5sNUxMOEdaVTNUNFE&usp=drive_web#gid=0">sign up</a> if you interested, we have a weekly game of 42 going), cooking (it's all in the stock), trying my best to keep house plants alive (not doing very well at this), catching a play (I think <a href="http://www.rudemechs.com/">Rude Mechs</a> is the greatest), or planning my next backpaking adventure (did Glacier in Montana this past year).
